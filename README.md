## About Our Project
For our final project in CSCI205, we decided to create a program that plays through
the game of Flappy Bird. We chose this project because we wanted to challenge ourselves 
and create a game which would not only emulate the classic game we all grew up playing, 
but also be able to add power ups and have a co-op mode. 

For this game, we decided to build a flappy bird game that would be able to be played by 
not only one player, but also two players. We wanted to add a twist to the classic game 
because we felt that it would be more fun to play with a friend, as well as have a few power
ups that would make the game more interesting. Being able to create such a game not only lets 
us see how far we have come in our programming skills, but also allows us to see how we can create
an adaptation to make a classic game more unique.

## Third Party Libraries
For our Flappy Bird game, other than the Java library, we also incorporated these libraries:
- javafx.animation https://openjfx.io/javadoc/11/javafx.graphics/javafx/animation/Animation.html
- javafx.application https://openjfx.io/javadoc/11/javafx.graphics/javafx/application/Application.html
- javafx.scene https://openjfx.io/javadoc/11/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/package-summary.html
- javafx.util https://openjfx.io/javadoc/11/javafx.base/javafx/util/package-summary.html
- javax.sound https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/sound/index.html
